## About me
Since I was born Iâ€™ve been fascinated about physics and electronics. I spent my childhood disarming and experimenting with everything that came into my way. Then I received my first computer which became my encyclopedia. I discovered Bitcoin in 2013 and I understood pretty quickly what it was going on, I'm sorry I was too young back then. I decided to learn coding when I saw that it was the way in which logic was mixed with electronics and since then software development has become a passion.

### RatherLabs - Web3/Fullstack - 10 months (Actually)
##### React + Next13 + Prisma + TRPC | Solidity + Ethers + Hardhat + Slither + Tenderly | Netlify, Vercel, AWS Lambda.
During my time at Ratherlabs, I had been working on several exciting projects that showcased my skills and expertise. Here's a closer look at my contributions:

**Transcribeme -** I was part of the team that developed Transcribeme, an AI service that transformed audio messages from WhatsApp into written text. We leveraged OpenAI's technology and integrated GPT for accurate and efficient transcription. This project aimed to make communication easier and more accessible by enabling users to read their audio messages.

**Huntify -** Using the power of OpenAI and Next.js + TRPC, I created a platform that generated tailored interview questions and evaluated candidates. This not only streamlined the hiring process but also provided valuable feedback to candidates, reducing interview times significantly.

**Micropets -** I worked solo on migrating proxy contracts to new ownership and introduced staking mechanisms. Additionally, created new NFT collections adhering to the ERC721 standard with a random opening chance feature, enhancing user engagement. On the frontend, I made UI/UX improvements and facilitated minting from both BSC and Ethereum chains, expanding our multichain capabilities.

**Technical Reviewer -** In addition to my software developer work, I took on the role of a technical reviewer. This involved conducting technical interviews for prospective candidates, evaluating their skills and assessing their suitability for the positions within the company.

My time at Ratherlabs was marked by a commitment to innovation and excellence, and I'm proud of the contributions I made to these projects and the growth of the team.

### Strider - Web3/Fullstack - 11 months 
##### React + Tailwind/Bootstrap, Node + Express/Nest, Solidity, Ethers, Hardhat, Slither, Tenderly, MongoDB, Netlify, and Heroku.
During my time at Strider, I worked as a Web3/Fullstack developer for 10 months. As the first developer/lead developer on the engineering team, I led the development of various Web3 and Web2 products for third-party clients (Axie infinity, treasureDAO, Smolverse, QuitCollective). Additionally, I was responsible for building the PoC/MVP of the Strider core product.

### Hubblesoft - Web3/Fullstack - 2 years 
##### React + Bootstrap, Node + Express, Solidity, Ethers, Hardhat, Slither, Tenderly, MongoDB, Firebase, SQL, Netlify, and Heroku.
Since participating in the 2017 Eth Hackathon in Buenos Aires, my interest in the Ethereum EVM has grown
exponentially. I have gained proficiency in Solidity and have worked as a freelancer on several web projects, 
developing and integrating smart contracts. Additionally, I have created bots that can interact with contracts on 
decentralized exchanges and classic exchanges for trading purposes or analysis. My curiosity has also led me to study
the mathematics and logic behind Flash-Loans, Pool, Swaps, Farming, and PoS in great depth.

### Wobax - Python/VBA/C Automation - 2 Years 
##### Python, VBA, C, MongoDB, Java, Node, PHP, Javascript, Boostrap, HTML & CSS.
I developed different scripts for Wobax.co that allowed the company to reduce the time to analyze data from 2 months to 1 day and different dashboards to visualize the results in a webapp.

### Freelance Web Designer - 2 Years
##### HTML & CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, PHP, MySQL.
I have developed over 50 websites and webapps, constantly aiming to improve upon each one to ensure they are better, cleaner, in UX/UI but also in coding practices.
