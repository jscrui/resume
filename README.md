## About me
Since I was born Iâ€™ve been fascinated about physics and electronics. I spent my childhood disarming and experimenting with everything that came into my way. Then I received my first computer which became my encyclopedia. I discovered Bitcoin in 2013 and I understood pretty quickly what it was going on, I'm sorry I was too young back then. I decided to learn coding when I saw that it was the way in which logic was mixed with electronics and since then software development has become a passion.

During my time at Strider, I worked as a Web3/Fullstack developer for 10 months.

Additionally, I was responsible for building the PoC/MVP of the Strider core product.

### Hubblesoft - Web3/Fullstack - 2 years 
##### React + Bootstrap, Node + Express, Solidity, Ethers, Hardhat, Slither, Tenderly, MongoDB, Firebase, SQL, Netlify, and Heroku.
Since participating in the 2017 Eth Hackathon in Buenos Aires, my interest in the Ethereum EVM has grown
exponentially. I have gained proficiency in Solidity and have worked as a freelancer on several web projects, 
developing and integrating smart contracts. Additionally, I have created bots that can interact with contracts on 
decentralized exchanges and classic exchanges for trading purposes or analysis. My curiosity has also led me to study
the mathematics and logic behind Flash-Loans, Pool, Swaps, Farming, and PoS in great depth.
